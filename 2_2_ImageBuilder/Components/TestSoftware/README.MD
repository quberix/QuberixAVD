# Test files

In order to provide some files for installation as part of this deployment, please drop a couple of EXE and/or MSI files in this
repo and modify the builder environment you will be using to reflect this change.

By default the repo uses the following:

- The 2201, 64 bit version of 7-Zip MSI from: [7-zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
- The 1.9.4 version of KDIFF from: [download.kde.org](https://download.kde.org/stable/kdiff3/)

These demonstrate the installation of an MSI file and an EXE file using software from reputable sources.
